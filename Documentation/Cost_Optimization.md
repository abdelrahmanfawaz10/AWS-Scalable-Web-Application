## Compute Optimization
- Use of burstable EC2 instances (t3.micro / t3.small)
- Auto Scaling reduces the number of running instances during low traffic

## Pay-as-You-Go Model
- No upfront infrastructure cost
- Resources scale based on actual demand

## Monitoring Costs
- CloudWatch metrics used to analyze utilization
- Identify undesired resources

## Database Cost Optimization (Optional)
- Right-sized RDS instances
- Automated backups with defined retention period

## Resource Cleanup
- Terminate unused EC2 instances
- Delete unused load balancers and snapshots after testing

## Cost Optimization Benefits
- Reduced operational cost
- Efficient resource utilization
- Optimized cloud spending
